    "text": "1.1 An introductory example\nLet’s start this with a problem. A problem which clearly illustrates why we need statistics. Put your mind back to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Very quickly after understanding the health risks by the Covid-19 virus in early 2020 attention turned to the one health tool that was very quickly identified as the “game changer” in the fight against the virus. A vaccine. In the time series plot below (Figure 1.1) you can see how often people worldwide searched for the term “Covid-19 vaccine”.\nVery quickly many different research teams, in private companies, universities and government institutions started researching such vaccines. Very quickly the first companies published results of trials to investigate whether the vaccines they had developed worked. Here is a link to one of the first publication of preliminary results by the Pfizer/Biontech consortium from 18 November 2020.\nIn this news story you can find the following information\nThe information on the efficacy was pounced on by news organisations, in particular the 95% efficacy rate. Let us look at how this is calculated. There were 170 cases of covid amongst the around 40,000 trial participants. Around half the trial participants had received the Biontech vaccince (the treatment group) whereas the other half had received a placebo (meaning they also had a shot, but it did not contain any vaccine, the Control group). The numbers in the two groups were about equal (a piece of information not immediately obvious from the news story but available from other sources.)\nThe way how the efficacy measure is calculated is as follows\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    efficacy = 1 -\\frac{\\text{Number of cases in Treatment Group}}{\\text{Number of cases in Control Group}}=1-\\frac{8}{162}=0.9506=95.06\\%\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThat is the 95% figure quoted in the above news story. It gives you the reduction in probability of getting the disease by being vaccinated.\nYou can see that from a different perspective, using additional data from David Spiegelhalter’s excellent little book Covid by Numbers.\nIn the last line of the above Table you can see that the probability of contracting the Covid-19 virus in the Control Group was 0.884%. One way to think about efficacy is to think about how much this risk is reduced by having received a vaccine. An efficacy of 95% suggests that this risk is reduced by 95%, hence the risk should be 0.884%∗5%=0.884%∗0.05=0.0442% which is indeed approximately the number you see in the above table.\nHere is the BBC reporting on these trial results on 9 November 2020.",

If you had different sample sizes in the experimental (\\(n_e\\)) and control group (\\(n_c\\)) you would calculate \\(1-((5/n_e)/(134/n_c))\\). From here you can see that \\(n_c\\) and \\(n_e\\) would cancel out if they were the same.",

    "text": "1.2 And where is the statistics in this?\nAt the completion of the course you will realise that behind these numbers there are a number of interesting questions one may want to ask.\n\nAs we have a sample of data, can we express how certain we are about the 95% efficacy?\nThe WHO demands that vaccines should have a 50% efficacy, given our uncertainty, do we believe that this vaccine if effective?\nSurely the efficacy may vary with some demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity). Can we figure out which demographic factors make the vaccine more effective?\n\nIt turns out that statisticians can help you will these type of questions and more!\nThe subject of statistics is concerned with scientific methods for collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting data (numerical information). The power and utility of statistics derives from being able to draw valid conclusions (inferences), and make reasonable decisions, on the basis the available data. (The term statistics is also used in a much narrower sense when referring to the data themselves or various other numbers derived from any given set of data. Thus we hear of employment statistics (% of people unemployed), accident statistics, (number of road accidents involving drunk drivers), etc.)\nData arise in many spheres of human and natural activity. Such data may be obtained as a matter of course (e.g., meteorological records, daily closing prices of shares, monthly interest rates, etc.), or they may be collected by survey or experiment for the purposes of a specific statistical investigation. An example of an investigation using statistics was the Survey of British Births, 1970, the aim of which was to improve the survival rate and care of British babies at or soon after birth. To this end, data on new born babies and their mothers were collected and analysed. The Family Expenditure Survey regularly collects information on household expenditure patterns - including amounts spent on lottery tickets.\nOften different methods are used to effectively collect information on the same issue. Especially when the issue is very important it is often useful to have several different sources of data in order to cross-check the findings. Take, as an example, the issue of measuring how many people have been infected by Covid-19. In the UK, several sources have been used to estimate these numbers. The most attention was given to the number of positive test results reported. On the other hand, the Office for national Statistics also ran a survey across the entire population (hoping to generate a sample as representative as possible), the COVID-19 Infection Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is not an actual surveys run in the UK? Of course you are not expected to know this by heart, but you should be able quickly confirm whether these exist via a websearch.\n\n Crime Survey for England and Wales Active Lifestyle Survey, Measuring sporting activities in UK Pensioners General Lifestyle Survey National Travel Survey Young People’s Social Attitudes Survey\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nAll but the “Active Lifestyle Survey, Measuring sporting activities in UK Pensioners” surveys are real surveys. A good overview of many UK surveys is available from the UK Data Service. While the above survey does not exist, there is in fact a survey investigating the amount of activities done by people in the UK. This survey is organised by Sport England but does not specifically focus on pensioners.",

    "section": "1.3 What we will learn",
    "text": "1.3 What we will learn\nYou can divide the material you will learn in this course in three sections.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nProbability Calculus\nInferential Statistics\n\nLet me give you short descriptions of what these sections will be about and how they will fit together. As you go through the material I recommend that you return to this short section such that you never loose sight of the bigger picture.\n\n1.3.1 Descriptive Statistics\nIn this section we will look at a sample of data and use a variety of methods to describe what we see in the sample. Say you have just received the data for the 36,514 subjects in the Biontech Covid vaccine trial. Your supervisor asks you to summarise the data for her. Summarising means saying something about the data with less than the 36,514 pieces of information.\nWe will find ways to summarise the information with a few numbers (statistics). For instance the proportion of subjects who got infected with covid. You may also want to present some graphical ways to summarise the data. This type of activity has value in itself. In fact a lot of the data presented in the news is basically done with the use of summary statistics.\n\n\n1.3.2 Probability Calculus\nIf you play any games like roulette, cards (e.g. poker or blackjack or even UNO) or any other games of chance you will be aware that outcomes of many events are random. Importantly, random doesn’t mean that we don’t know anything about the potential outcomes. Take a dice. Before you roll the dice you do not know the outcome, but what you do know is that the probability of each outcome is 1/6. In other words we know the probability distribution of the random variable.\nIn the probability section you will learn to calculate with the properties of random variables. In particular you will learn to calculate expected values, variances and correlations between multiple random variables. You will also learn about a number of common, even famous, random distributions.\n\n\n1.3.3 Inferential Statistics\nIn some sense this is the high point of the statistical knowledge you will learn in this unit. We will often have information about a particular sample (like the sample from the Biontech vaccine trial), hopefully drawn at random. Using descriptive statistics we can find out everything there is to know about the sample (e.g. mean, variance, skewness, correlation if we have a sample on multiple variables). However, usually we are not really interested in the sample itself, the sample is merely a window into the population and we really want to know things about the population (see the schematic in (fig_inference?)). In terms of the example, we are interested in how the vaccine would work in the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Schematic of Statistical Inference and how it relates to descriptive statistics and probability calculus.\n\n\n\nIn order to learn anything from the sample about the population we need two key tools. First, we need to be able to describe the sample (descriptive statistics) and we need to learn how to calculate with probabilities. After all we will not be able to make statements about the population with certainty, we will only be able to make probabilistic statements. Here is a video discussion of the basics of statistical inference (7.44 min).",

    "text": "2.1 Types of data\nBroadly speaking, by data we mean numerical values associated with some variable of interest. Different types of data may need special treatment when it comes to statistical analysis. For this reason, it is important to be able to distinguish a few key features. A variable can produce data that are either of continuous or discrete nature (see below for examples).\nAnother level at which variables differ is whether they are sampled in time or in a cross-section.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1.1 Discrete data\nThe variable \\(X\\) is said to be discrete if it can only ever yield isolated values some of which (if not all) are often repeated in the sample. It is, however, important to note that there are different types of discrete data:\n\nORDINAL. Here the categories have a natural ordering.\nExamples: Football Leagues: Premier League, Championship, etc.\nNOMINAL. Here there is no natural ordering to the categories.\nExamples: Gender: Male, Female\nCOUNT. A variable that represents the counts of certain events.\nExamples: Number of children in household: 0,1,2,3,etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningData collection is not always neutral\n\n\n\nBefore moving on from here it is important to understand that the mere process of collecting data may not be an innocent or totally neutral process. For instance the above note on gender. Traditionally you would indeed have found questions like “What is your gender?” with “Male” and “Female” being the only options. It is now widely recognised that for some people the gender they identify as is not the same as the sex they were born in. As a consequence of this you will now find that sometimes questions are split, one asking for the sex and the other for gender identification. Both public and private institutions think carefully about how to ask such questions as demonstrated by the guidance of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and by Survey Monkey.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Continuous data\nThe variable \\(Y\\) is said to be continuous if it can assume any value taken (more or less) from a continuum (a continuum is an interval, or range of numbers). A nice way to distinguish between a discrete and continuous variable is to consider the possibility of listing possible values. It is theoretically impossible to even begin listing all possible values that a continuous variable \\(Y\\) could assume. However, this is not so with a discrete variable; you may not always be able to finish the list, but at least you can make a start.\nFor example, the birth-weight of babies is an example of a continuous variable. There is no reason why a baby should not have a birth weight of \\(2500.0234\\) grams, even though it wouldn’t be measured as such! Try to list all possible weights (in theory) bearing in mind that for any two weights that you write down, there will always be another possibility half way between these. We see, then, that for a continuous variable an observation is recorded, as the result of applying some measurement, but that this inevitably gives rise to a rounding (up or down) of the actual value. (No such rounding occurs when recording observations on a discrete variable.)\nA variable can be continuous even though it is defined on a limited scale. For instance the weight variable has a limited scale as weights cannot be negative.\nFinally, note that for a continuous variable, it is unlikely that values will be repeated frequently in the sample, unless rounding occurs.\nOther examples of continuous data include: heights of people; volume of water in a reservoir; and, to a workable approximation, Government Expenditure. One could argue that the last of these is discrete (due to the finite divisibility of monetary units). However, when the amounts involved are of the order of millions of pounds, changes at the level of individual pence are hardly discernible and so it is sensible to treat the variable as continuous.\n\n\n2.1.3 Additional resources\n\nKhan Academy: Discusses example of continuous and discrete random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nThe heights of your friends\nDiscreteContinuous\nThe number of books on your bookcase\nDiscreteContinuous\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Cross-section data\nCross-section data comprises observations on a particular variable taken at a single point in time. For example: annual crime figures recorded by Police regions for the year 1999; the birth-weight of babies born, in a particular maternity unit, during the month of April 1998; initial salaries of graduates from the University of Manchester, 2012.\nNote, the defining feature is that there is no natural ordering in the data you have. Say you have birth weights of babies Sarah, Lin, Max and Nikolai, then it doesn’t matter if you present that data in that order or if you re-order the data in any way, e.g. Nikola, Sarah, Max and Lin. This will be different for time-series data.\n\n2.1.4.1 Example\nExchange Rates: From Oanda.com\nHere you can see a lot of different exchange rates, all recorded at the same time. Note, however, that they are updated every 5 minutes. So you can see that whether you are dealing with cross-section or time-series data (see below) depends on your perspective.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Time-series data\nOn the other hand, time-series data are observations on a particular variable recorded over a period of time, at regular intervals. For example personal crime figures for Greater Manchester recorded annually from 1980-2012; monthly household expenditure on food; the daily closing price of a certain stock. In this case, the data does have a natural ordering since they are measured from one time period to the next.\n\n2.1.5.1 Example\nExchange Rates: From USD v EURO exchange rate from the ECB\nAn example for a time-series of an exchange rate, here USD/EUR.\n ::: {.callout-important} ### Exercises\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nStudy hours data from students responding to a survey after the 2nd week of semester.\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data\nTemperatures at 8am on the 22 Jan 2026 from all British cities\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data\nTemperatures at 8am in Manchester for all days in 2025\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data\n:::",

    "section": "2.2 Population and Sample Data",
    "text": "2.2 Population and Sample Data\nWhen dealing with data we will have to be aware of what the difference between population and sample data are. The population represents all the data you are interested in. Imagine you have asked all households in your postcode area for their annual income. In case you are interested in the incomes in your postcode only, then your observations represent the population data. If however, you are really interested in the average household income of ALL households in Manchester, then the data you have collected in your postcode are a sample only. As you can see, the same set of observations can be either a sample or population, it really depends on the question you are asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRepresentative Sampling\n\n\n\nBriefly thinking about the example above where you collect all data from one postcode to be a sample for all of Manchester, it quickly becomes obvious that this would not be a good sampling strategy. If you were fortunate enough to live in a posh are (e.g. Hale Barns) it would be very obvious that the incomes you collected would not be very representative of the incomes across the whole of Manchester.\nIf you want a representative sample you will have to be very careful in the way you design your sampling strategy to achieve that. This is super important. Here we will not cover any more details on this and when we use survey data we will assume that the data are representative. If you are interested in this topic a good resource is: Czaja, R. and Blair, J. (2013) Designing Surveys: a guide to decisions and procedures. 3rd ed. Sage, London.\n\n\nGiven any particular question, we always prefer to have population data, however in most cases one will have to accept that one can only get sample data. Consider, for instance, a political analyst who is interested in the voting intentions of all eligible voters in the UK. As there are many millions voters it is virtually impossible to obtain population data. You will all be familiar with opinion polls who will be based on the basis of a sample of eligible voters (usually somewhere around 1000 voters).\nThe interesting question is then the following: Given the analyst is really interested in the voting intention of ALL voters, how can the sample information be used to learn something about the population? This problem is at heart of the problem of statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nA safety inspector conducts air quality tests on a randomly selected group of 16 classrooms at a primary school.\n\n The population is all classrooms in the primary school; the sample is the 16 classrooms The population is all primary students in the school; the sample is the students in the 16 classrooms selected. The population is all classrooms in the district; the sample is the 16 classrooms selected.\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe population is the entire group of people or things we want to study. The sample is the part of the population that we actually collect data from.\nThe safety inspector tested classrooms in the primary school, not students. Further, the safety inspector only tested classrooms in one school, not in all the schools in the district. So the safety inspector selected 16 classrooms.\nThe population is all classrooms in the primary school; the sample is the 16 classrooms selected.\n\nThe Director of A High School surveyed a random sample of 200 of their juniors to see how juniors at the school felt about the lunch offering at the school’s cafeteria.\n\n The population is all high school juniors in the world; the sample is all of the juniors at A High. The population is all students at A High; the sample is all of the juniors at A High The population is all juniors at A High School; the sample is the 200 juniors surveyed.",
