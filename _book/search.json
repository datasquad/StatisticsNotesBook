    "text": "1.1 An introductory example\nLet’s start this with a problem. A problem which clearly illustrates why we need statistics. Put your mind back to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Very quickly after understanding the health risks by the Covid-19 virus in early 2020 attention turned to the one health tool that was very quickly identified as the “game changer” in the fight against the virus. A vaccine. In the time series plot below (Figure 2.1) you can see how often people worldwide searched for the term “Covid-19 vaccine”.\nVery quickly many different research teams, in private companies, universities and government institutions started researching such vaccines. Very quickly the first companies published results of trials to investigate whether the vaccines they had developed worked. Here is a link to one of the first publication of preliminary results by the Pfizer/Biontech consortium from 18 November 2020.\nIn this news story you can find the following information\nThe information on the efficacy was pounced on by news organisations, in particular the 95% efficacy rate. Let us look at how this is calculated. There were 170 cases of covid amongst the around 40,000 trial participants. Around half the trial participants had received the Biontech vaccince (the treatment group) whereas the other half had received a placebo (meaning they also had a shot, but it did not contain any vaccine, the Control group). The numbers in the two groups were about equal (a piece of information not immediately obvious from the news story but available from other sources.)\nThe way how the efficacy measure is calculated is as follows\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    efficacy = 1 -\\frac{\\text{Number of cases in Treatment Group}}{\\text{Number of cases in Control Group}}=1-\\frac{8}{162}=0.9506=95.06\\%\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThat is the 95% figure quoted in the above news story. It gives you the reduction in probability of getting the disease by being vaccinated.\nYou can see that from a different perspective, using additional data from David Spiegelhalter’s excellent little book Covid by Numbers.\nIn the last line of the above Table you can see that the probability of contracting the Covid-19 virus in the Control Group was 0.884%. One way to think about efficacy is to think about how much this risk is reduced by having received a vaccine. An efficacy of 95% suggests that this risk is reduced by 95%, hence the risk should be 0.884%∗5%=0.884%∗0.05=0.0442% which is indeed approximately the number you see in the above table.\nHere is the BBC reporting on these trial results on 9 November 2020.",

If you had different sample sizes in the experimental (\\(n_e\\)) and control group (\\(n_c\\)) you would calculate \\(1-((5/n_e)/(134/n_c))\\).

    "text": "1.2 And where is the statistics in this?\nAt the completion of the course you will realise that behind these numbers there are a number of interesting questions one may want to ask.\n\nAs we have a sample of data, can we express how certain we are about the 95% efficacy?\nThe WHO demands that vaccines should have a 50% efficacy, given our uncertainty, do we believe that this vaccine if effective?\nSurely the efficacy may vary with some demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity). Can we figure out which demographic factors make the vaccine more effective?\n\nIt turns out that statisticians can help you will these type of questions and more!\nThe subject of statistics is concerned with scientific methods for collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting data (numerical information). The power and utility of statistics derives from being able to draw valid conclusions (inferences), and make reasonable decisions, on the basis the available data. (The term statistics is also used in a much narrower sense when referring to the data themselves or various other numbers derived from any given set of data. Thus we hear of employment statistics (% of people unemployed), accident statistics, (number of road accidents involving drunk drivers), etc.)\nData arise in many spheres of human and natural activity. Such data may be obtained as a matter of course (e.g., meteorological records, daily closing prices of shares, monthly interest rates, etc.), or they may be collected by survey or experiment for the purposes of a specific statistical investigation. An example of an investigation using statistics was the Survey of British Births, 1970, the aim of which was to improve the survival rate and care of British babies at or soon after birth. To this end, data on new born babies and their mothers were collected and analysed. The Family Expenditure Survey regularly collects information on household expenditure patterns - including amounts spent on lottery tickets.\nOften different methods are used to effectively collect information on the same issue. Especially when the issue is very important it is often useful to have several different sources of data in order to cross-check the findings. Take, as an example, the issue of measuring how many people have been infected by Covid-19. In the UK, several sources have been used to estimate these numbers. The most attention was given to the number of positive test results reported. On the other hand, the Office for national Statistics also ran a survey across the entire population (hoping to generate a sample as representative as possible), the COVID-19 Infection Survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is not an actual surveys run in the UK? Of course you are not expected to know this by heart, but you should be able quickly confirm whether these exist via a websearch.\n\n Crime Survey for England and Wales Active Lifestyle Survey, Measuring sporting activities in UK Pensioners General Lifestyle Survey National Travel Survey Young People’s Social Attitudes Survey\n\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nAll but the “Active Lifestyle Survey, Measuring sporting activities in UK Pensioners” surveys are real surveys. A good overview of many UK surveys is available from the UK Data Service. While the above survey does not exist, there is in fact a survey investigating the amount of activities done by people in the UK. This survey is organised by Sport England but does not specifically focus on pensioners.",

    "section": "1.3 What we will learn",
    "text": "1.3 What we will learn\nYou can divide the material you will learn in this course in three sections.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nProbability Calculus\nInferential Statistics\n\nLet me give you short descriptions of what these sections will be about and how they will fit together. As you go through the material I recommend that you return to this short section such that you never loose sight of the bigger picture.\n\n1.3.1 Descriptive Statistics\nIn this section we will look at a sample of data and use a variety of methods to describe what we see in the sample. Say you have just received the data for the 36,514 subjects in the Biontech Covid vaccine trial. Your supervisor asks you to summarise the data for her. Summarising means saying something about the data with less than the 36,514 pieces of information.\nWe will find ways to summarise the information with a few numbers (statistics). For instance the proportion of subjects who got infected with covid. You may also want to present some graphical ways to summarise the data. This type of activity has value in itself. In fact a lot of the data presented in the news is basically done with the use of summary statistics.\n\n\n1.3.2 Probability Calculus\nIf you play any games like roulette, cards (e.g. poker or blackjack or even UNO) or any other games of chance you will be aware that outcomes of many events are random. Importantly, random doesn’t mean that we don’t know anything about the potential outcomes. Take a dice. Before you roll the dice you do not know the outcome, but what you do know is that the probability of each outcome is 1/6. In other words we know the probability distribution of the random variable.\nIn the probability section you will learn to calculate with the properties of random variables. In particular you will learn to calculate expected values, variances and correlations between multiple random variables. You will also learn about a number of common, even famous, random distributions.\n\n\n1.3.3 Inferential Statistics\nIn some sense this is the high point of the statistical knowledge you will learn in this unit. We will often have information about a particular sample (like the sample from the Biontech vaccine trial), hopefully drawn at random. Using descriptive statistics we can find out everything there is to know about the sample (e.g. mean, variance, skewness, correlation if we have a sample on multiple variables). However, usually we are not really interested in the sample itself, the sample is merely a window into the population and we really want to know things about the population (see the schematic in (fig_inference?)). In terms of the example, we are interested in how the vaccine would work in the population.\n\n\n\nSchematic of Statistical Inference and how it relates to descriptive statistics and probability calculus.\n\n\nIn order to learn anything from the sample about the population we need two key tools. First, we need to be able to describe the sample (descriptive statistics) and we need to learn how to calculate with probabilities. After all we will not be able to make statements about the population with certainty, we will only be able to make probabilistic statements. Here is a video discussion of the basics of statistical inference (7.44 min).",

    "text": "2.1 Types of data\nBroadly speaking, by data we mean numerical values associated with some variable of interest. Different types of data may need special treatment when it comes to statistical analysis. For this reason, it is important to be able to distinguish a few key features. A variable can produce data that are either of continuous or discrete nature (see below for examples).\nAnother level at which variables differ is whether they are sampled in time or in a cross-section.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1.1 Discrete data\nThe variable \\(X\\) is said to be discrete if it can only ever yield isolated values some of which (if not all) are often repeated in the sample. It is, however, important to note that there are different types of discrete data:\n\nORDINAL. Here the categories have a natural ordering.\nExamples: Football Leagues: Premier League, Championship, etc.\nNOMINAL. Here there is no natural ordering to the categories.\nExamples: Gender: Male, Female\nCOUNT. A variable that represents the counts of certain events.\nExamples: Number of children in household: 0,1,2,3,etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningData collection is not always neutral\n\n\n\nBefore moving on from here it is important to understand that the mere process of collecting data may not be an innocent or totally neutral process. For instance the above note on gender. Traditionally you would indeed have found questions like “What is your gender?” with “Male” and “Female” being the only options. It is now widely recognised that for some people the gender they identify as is not the same as the sex they were born in. As a consequence of this you will now find that sometimes questions are split, one asking for the sex and the other for gender identification. Both public and private institutions think carefully about how to ask such questions as demonstrated by the guidance of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and by Survey Monkey.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Continuous data\nThe variable \\(Y\\) is said to be continuous if it can assume any value taken (more or less) from a continuum (a continuum is an interval, or range of numbers). A nice way to distinguish between a discrete and continuous variable is to consider the possibility of listing possible values. It is theoretically impossible to even begin listing all possible values that a continuous variable \\(Y\\) could assume. However, this is not so with a discrete variable; you may not always be able to finish the list, but at least you can make a start.\nFor example, the birth-weight of babies is an example of a continuous variable. There is no reason why a baby should not have a birth weight of \\(2500.0234\\) grams, even though it wouldn’t be measured as such! Try to list all possible weights (in theory) bearing in mind that for any two weights that you write down, there will always be another possibility half way between these. We see, then, that for a continuous variable an observation is recorded, as the result of applying some measurement, but that this inevitably gives rise to a rounding (up or down) of the actual value. (No such rounding occurs when recording observations on a discrete variable.)\nA variable can be continuous even though it is defined on a limited scale. For instance the weight variable has a limited scale as weights cannot be negative.\nFinally, note that for a continuous variable, it is unlikely that values will be repeated frequently in the sample, unless rounding occurs.\nOther examples of continuous data include: heights of people; volume of water in a reservoir; and, to a workable approximation, Government Expenditure. One could argue that the last of these is discrete (due to the finite divisibility of monetary units). However, when the amounts involved are of the order of millions of pounds, changes at the level of individual pence are hardly discernible and so it is sensible to treat the variable as continuous.\n\n\n2.1.3 Additional resources\n\nKhan Academy: Discusses example of continuous and discrete random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nThe heights of your friends\nDiscreteContinuous\nThe number of books on your bookcase\nDiscreteContinuous\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Cross-section data\nCross-section data comprises observations on a particular variable taken at a single point in time. For example: annual crime figures recorded by Police regions for the year 1999; the birth-weight of babies born, in a particular maternity unit, during the month of April 1998; initial salaries of graduates from the University of Manchester, 2012.\nNote, the defining feature is that there is no natural ordering in the data you have. Say you have birth weights of babies Sarah, Lin, Max and Nikolai, then it doesn’t matter if you present that data in that order or if you re-order the data in any way, e.g. Nikola, Sarah, Max and Lin. This will be different for time-series data.\n\n2.1.4.1 Example\nExchange Rates: From Oanda.com\nHere you can see a lot of different exchange rates, all recorded at the same time. Note, however, that they are updated every 5 minutes. So you can see that whether you are dealing with cross-section or time-series data (see below) depends on your perspective.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Time-series data\nOn the other hand, time-series data are observations on a particular variable recorded over a period of time, at regular intervals. For example personal crime figures for Greater Manchester recorded annually from 1980-2012; monthly household expenditure on food; the daily closing price of a certain stock. In this case, the data does have a natural ordering since they are measured from one time period to the next.\n\n2.1.5.1 Example\nExchange Rates: From USD v EURO exchange rate from the ECB\nAn example for a time-series of an exchange rate, here USD/EUR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: USD/Euro exchange rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nStudy hours data from students responding to a survey after the 2nd week of semester.\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data\nTemperatures at 8am on the 22 Jan 2026 from all British cities\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data\nTemperatures at 8am in Manchester for all days in 2025\nTime-Series DataCross-Section Data",

    "section": "2.2 Population and Sample Data",
    "text": "2.2 Population and Sample Data\nWhen dealing with data we will have to be aware of what the difference between population and sample data are. The population represents all the data you are interested in. Imagine you have asked all households in your postcode area for their annual income. In case you are interested in the incomes in your postcode only, then your observations represent the population data. If however, you are really interested in the average household income of ALL households in Manchester, then the data you have collected in your postcode are a sample only. As you can see, the same set of observations can be either a sample or population, it really depends on the question you are asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRepresentative Sampling\n\n\n\nBriefly thinking about the example above where you collect all data from one postcode to be a sample for all of Manchester, it quickly becomes obvious that this would not be a good sampling strategy. If you were fortunate enough to live in a posh are (e.g. Hale Barns) it would be very obvious that the incomes you collected would not be very representative of the incomes across the whole of Manchester.\nIf you want a representative sample you will have to be very careful in the way you design your sampling strategy to achieve that. This is super important. Here we will not cover any more details on this and when we use survey data we will assume that the data are representative. If you are interested in this topic a good resource is: Czaja, R. and Blair, J. (2013) Designing Surveys: a guide to decisions and procedures. 3rd ed. Sage, London.\n\n\nGiven any particular question, we always prefer to have population data, however in most cases one will have to accept that one can only get sample data. Consider, for instance, a political analyst who is interested in the voting intentions of all eligible voters in the UK. As there are many millions voters it is virtually impossible to obtain population data. You will all be familiar with opinion polls who will be based on the basis of a sample of eligible voters (usually somewhere around 1000 voters).\nThe interesting question is then the following: Given the analyst is really interested in the voting intention of ALL voters, how can the sample information be used to learn something about the population? This problem is at heart of the problem of statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nConsider if the following set of data is discrete or continuous:\nA safety inspector conducts air quality tests on a randomly selected group of 16 classrooms at a primary school.\n\n The population is all classrooms in the primary school; the sample is the 16 classrooms The population is all primary students in the school; the sample is the students in the 16 classrooms selected. The population is all classrooms in the district; the sample is the 16 classrooms selected.\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe population is the entire group of people or things we want to study. The sample is the part of the population that we actually collect data from.\nThe safety inspector tested classrooms in the primary school, not students. Further, the safety inspector only tested classrooms in one school, not in all the schools in the district. So the safety inspector selected 16 classrooms.\nThe population is all classrooms in the primary school; the sample is the 16 classrooms selected.\n\nThe Director of A High School surveyed a random sample of 200 of their juniors to see how juniors at the school felt about the lunch offering at the school’s cafeteria.\n\n The population is all high school juniors in the world; the sample is all of the juniors at A High. The population is all students at A High; the sample is all of the juniors at A High The population is all juniors at A High School; the sample is the 200 juniors surveyed.",

This is a snippet of the data in the spreadsheet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Data of Titanic passengers\n\n\n\nBy summarising the data we find the following summary information, the number of passengers in each class and the proportion (or relative frequency).\n\n\n\n\nPassengers\nProportion\n\n\n\n\n1st Class\n322\n0.2452 = 24.52%\n\n\n2nd class\n280\n0.2133 = 21.33%\n\n\n3rd Class\n711\n0.5415 = 54.15%\n\n\nTotal\n1,313\n1.0000\n\n\n\nThis information can then be shown in a bar chart. Below we show a bar chart each for the number of observations (frequency) and the proportion (relative frequency).\n\n\n\nData of Titanic passengers\n\n\n\nThis diagram, simply places a bar of height equal to the appropriate frequency (left chart) or proportion (right chart) for the different classes. Notice that the bars are separated by spaces (i.e., they are isolated) which exemplifies the discrete nature of the data.\nBoth diagrams basically display the same information and in fact the only differences are the scales on the vertical axis. We see from the diagram on the left that 322 passengers traveled First Class and from the diagram on the right that the relative frequency of 1st Class Passengers is 0.25, or 25%. Similarly, 54% were 3rd Class passengers. It is a property of discrete data that we can easily add proportions of different classes to come to new meaningful categories. I.e. 75% of passengers (21% + 54%) did not enjoy First Class Luxury.\nWhether you use the frequency or the proportion diagram depends on whether it is more important to see the absolute number or the proportions of passengers in the different classes.\nAfter this example, let us look at a formal definition of relative frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition - relative Frequency\n\n\n\nIf a sample consists of \\(n\\) individuals (or items), and \\(m\\leq n\\) of these have a particular characteristic, denoted \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), then the relative frequency (or proportion) of characteristic \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) in the sample is calculated as \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\). The percentage of observations with characteristic \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) in the sample would be \\(\\frac{m}{n} \\times 100\\). E.g. 0.65 is equivalent to 65%.",

The distribution of the data can be summarised, graphically, using a histogram which is constructed as follows:\n\nGroup the raw data into intervals/classes, not necessarily of the same width:\n\nthe data are continuous, so there must (in general) be no spaces between intervals\nthe number of intervals chosen is often a fine judgement: not too many, but not too few. Depending on the data 5 to 10 is often sufficient, but in the end you should choose the number of intervals to give you informative picture about the distribution of the data. Below we have chosen 8 intervals with the first being ([0,10)) where 0 is called the lower class limit and 10 is the upper class limit. The class width (of any interval) is the difference between the upper class limit and the lower class limit. For the first interval this is (10-0=10).\nrecord the frequency in each interval; i.e., record the number of observations which fall in each of the constructed intervals\n\nFor each frequency, calculate the relative frequency, which is the frequency divided by total number of observations.\nFor each relative frequency construct a number called the density (of the interval) which is obtained as relative frequency divided by class width.\n\nIn the case of the age for passengers on the Titanic this gives rise to the following grouped frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaiting time\nclass width\nmid-point\nfrequency\nrel. freq.\ndensity\n\n\n\n\n[ a,b)\n(b-a)\n(a+b)/2\n\n\n\n\n\n[ 0,10)\n10\n5\n53\n0.00701\n0.0070\n\n\n[ 10,20)\n10\n15\n96\n0.1270\n0.0127\n\n\n[ 20,30)\n10\n25\n252\n0.3333\n0.0333\n\n\n[ 30,40)\n10\n35\n168\n0.2222\n0.0222\n\n\n[ 40,50)\n10\n45\n106\n0.1402\n0.0140\n\n\n[ 50,60)\n10\n55\n54\n0.0714\n0.0071\n\n\n[ 60,70)\n10\n65\n23\n0.0304\n0.0030\n\n\n[ 70,80)\n10\n75\n4\n0.0053\n0.0005\n\n\n\nNotice that the entries in the relative frequency column sum to 1, as they should (why?). The density calculation corresponds to the concept of density in a continuous distribution. If you calculated the size of the coloured area underneath the density histogram you would find this to equal 1.\nNow we can represent these results graphically. In fact you will sometimes see the frequencies, sometimes the relative frequencies and sometimes (although rarely) the densities represented on the vertical axis. In each case, really, the same information is conveyed and which one suits your purpose depends on what element you want to stress.\n\n\n\nFrequency, relative frequency and density histogram for ages of Titanic survivors.\n\n\n\nThis graph looks fairly similar to a bar chart, but note that the bars must be connected - no spaces. This reflects the fact that the data are continuous. On this occasion we chose 8 bins/classes. You could have created fewer or more, depending on how much detail you want to convey. But, unless you think they are informative, avoid constructing intervals, which contain no observations.",

    "text": "3.6 Two and more variables: Line graphs and Scatter plots\nThe graphical summaries, introduced above, are for summarising just one variable. An interesting question is whether two (or more) characteristics/random variables are inter-related. For example, referring to the previously used GDP growth data for which we have observations from Quarter 1 1955 to Quarter 1 2013.\n\n3.6.1 Two variables\nWe can add the inflation series (\\(inf_{i}\\)) to the line graph of the GDP growth rate.\n\n\n\nLine graph, GDP Growth rate (IHYN) and Inflation (L55O). Source: Office of National Statistics, UK.\n\n\nSuch graphs can be very revealing Although in this case it is not apparent that there is an obvious correlation between GDP growth and Inflation in the UK.\nA different type of graph often used to display how two variables are related to each other is a scatter plot. Below you can see two versions of a scatter plot displaying the same data shown in the above line graph.\n\n\n\nScatter plot, GDP Growth rate (IHYN) and Inflation (L55O). Source: Office of National Statistics, UK.\n\n\nOn the left hand side you can see the plot which shows all the data from 1989 (quarter 1) to 2021 (quarter 4). Each point represents one data point. For instance look at the one data point coloured in red in the South-West corner of the left scatter plot. That one point represents the observation from 2020 (Q2) in which GDP dropped by 13.1% and annual inflation was measured to be 0.8%.\nPerhaps you can see that the scale of this graph is driven by the very large GDP drop in Q2 2020 and the subsequent large reversal of 11.8% growth in Q3 of 2020. This compresses the vast majority of the data in the centre. Sometimes it may be worth to exclude some extreme observations (here the observations from the Year 2020 and 2021 representing the Covid period). The scatter plot on the right only shows the data up to 2019. You can now see that there is perhaps a slight positive correlation between these two variables.\nThis sort of diagram should not be viewed as way of detecting the precise nature of the relationship between the two variables and, in general, a lot of common sense is required as well. Rather, it merely illuminates the simplest, most basic, relation of whether larger \\(\\Delta gdp_{t}\\) values appear to be associated with larger (or smaller) values of the \\(inf_{t}\\) variable; thereby signifying an underlying positive (respectively, inverse or negative) observed relationship between the two. This may be suggestive about the general relationship but is by no means conclusive. Nor does it inform us on general cause and effect. It is impossible to conclude whether changes in \\(inf_{t}\\) actually cause changes in variable \\(\\Delta gdp_{t}\\) or vice versa. Indeed the two variables may not be related to each other at all. Therefore care must be taken in interpreting such a diagram.\n\nFor that reason scatter plots are more common for cross-sectional data which do not have a time series dimension. To illustrate this we will revert to a new example, relating to data from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let’s say we want to compare whether the case infection rates in countries at a particular point in time (say Week 10 in 2022) are in any way related to either how rich a country is (as measured by GDP per capita) or by how much a country spends on their Health System (as measured by the % pf GDP spend on Health).\nHere is a snippet of the spreadsheet used for this exercise.\n\n\n\nTable used for scatter diagram.\n\n\nYou can see that we have observations for different countries (in rows) which are all coming from the same time (2022-10). In columns we have different variables for each country, here the 14-day Covid-19 case rate (per 100,000), the Health expenditure (as a % of GDP), the GDP per capita and the (natural) log of GDP per capita.\nWe start by comparing the Covid case rate to the Health expenditure.\n\n\n\nScatter diagram, Health expenditure as percentage of GDP and 14-day Covid case rate, as per Week 10 in 2022.\n\n\nWhat you can see from such a scatter diagram is that there are only a few countries with very high case rates and there is no apparent correlation with the percentage of Health expenditure. Below we show scatter diagrams which relate the case rate to GDP per capita. In the left panel you can see GDP p.c. on the horizontal axis, and on the right panel you can see the same information, just that on the horizontal axis we now show the log of GDP p.c..\n\n\n\nScatter diagram, GDP per capita and 14-day Covid case rate, as per Week 10 in 2022.\n\n\nIn the scatter diagram on the left hand side (x axis: GDP p.c.) you can mainly see that there are a few countries which are incredibly reach and and a whole bunch of countries which have very lo GDP p.c. (less than $2,000 per year per person). When you have a variable on one of the axis which is so skewed, it can often be difficult to see interesting patterns.\nA common tool used in such circumstances is to scale the respective axis. Here we calculate the log of GDP p.c. and then use that on the horizontal axis (right panel). This has the effect of stretching out the GDP p.c. values at the lower end. Values of $500 and $2,000 are equivalent to approximately 6.2 and 7.6 on the logarithmic scale (as \\(ln(500) = 6.21\\) and \\(ln(2000)=7.60\\)). In this scatter diagram it is more apparent that there seems to be a positive correlation between income and covid case numbers.\nHowever, we ought to be careful and should not take these case numbers at face value. It may well be that poorer countries merely detect fewer of the existing cases.\n\n\n\n3.6.2 More than two series\nWe shall illustrate another potential pitfall when comparing time series with line graphs. For this we look at some Covid infection data across a number of different countries (Argentina, China, Italy, South Africa, Sweden and the UK). Let us first look at a line chart which compares the number of Covid infections across in the timespan from the beginning of 2020 to early 2022.\n\n\n\nLine graph. Weekly Covid cases. Source: European Center for Disease Control.\n\n\nFrom this line plot you can see that during the pandemic there were significant variations in registered Covid-19 cases across countries and across time. In particular it seems as if, for instance, the UK did fairly badly and Sweden and China did particularly well in terms of keeping the number of cases low. But you would be correct in interjecting that these countries have very different population sizes and therefore it may not be correct to compare these case numbers. It is for this reason that Covid-19 infections are usually reported as a case rate (infections per 100,000).\nThe next line graph, therefore, compares these case rates.\n\n\n\nLine graph. Weekly Covid cases per 100,000. Source: European Center for Disease Control.\n\n\nWhat we learn from here is quite different. It is still apparent that the officially reported case load in China is remarkably low. Sweden, however, cannot claim to have managed to keep the case load significantly lower than the other countries. The UK continues to have relatively high case rates. When looking at these data one also needs to keep in mind that the officially reported case numbers are significantly influenced by the testing regime. The late drop in UK cases at the beginning of 2022, for instance, is partly the result of the significant reduction in testing activity. May this be a reason for South Africa showing fairly modest infection rates across the entire Covid period?\nLet’s look at the equivalent data for Deaths related to Covid-19. While there is still significant variation across countries in terms of recording these, it is widely understood that mortality statistics are more comparable.\n\n\n\nLine graph. Weekly Covid deaths per 100,000. Source: European Center for Disease Control.\n\n\nWhen comparing these to the previous graphs it is apparent that fewer people are dying from Covid in late 2021 and 2022. This is due to significant vaccination rates. We can also see that South Africa has fairly comparable death rates compared to the other countries, indicating that the earlier infection rates may well be under-reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercises\n\n\n\nTo conclude this section answer the following question.\nLine graphs are an excellent tool to (multiple correct answers are possible)\n\n illustrate how a variable changes through time compare developments through time between a small number of units (like countries, states, companies, etc.) compare developments through time between many units (like countries, states, companies, etc.) to protect yourself against comparison of units of unequal size\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nIf you use too many units in a line plot it can quickly become impossible to read. In fact the six countries we used above are almost too many. Rarely is it useful to include more than 6 series in a time series plot. And you can actually use a line plot to make graphical comparisons which are not appropriate. We did so above when we looked at the absolute value of covid cases without adjusting for population size.",

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nInequality is one of the biggest issues societies around the world have to deal with. Some societies are organised in ways which result in income and wealth distributions which are fairly equal (such as Scandinavian countries), others however, such as the United States and many South American countries, are organised in ways which result in large income and wealth concentrations in the hands of small groups.\nInequalities arise not only in income and wealth, but also in terms of access to education and healthcare. It has also been documented that certain groups in society are not only disproportionally represented in lower income and wealth categories but also have unequal access to opportunities. It is for this reason that the issue of inequalities has lately regained prominence in the public discourse. Part of this discourse is that the field of economics has also increased its efforts to measure inequalities (for a summary refer to Our World in Data), understand the reasons for the existing inequalities and propose policies which could address inequalities which are deemed to be too extreme (for a current summary of such efforts see the IFS Deaton Review).\nA short video summary on the task taken on by the IFS Deaton Review on Inequality is available from here.\nIn the context of this statistics unit we are interested in income distributions as they are a very good example of how we use statistics. In particular we will look at different ways to summarise distributions of variables.\nHere is an image of the Income Distribution in the UK in 2019 form the ONS.\nThis is a histogram, a graphical representation of the UK income distribution. As you can see, most people in the UK earn incomes between UKP 10,000 and UKP 40,000. The word most is actually not a very well defined term. We will use better terms later. There is a fairly small proportion of people earning more than UKP 60,000 a year. The image says that the measure displayed in the image is “Equivalised household disposable income of individuals”. It is disposable because it is calculated as income after tax. Equivalised incomes take into account whether someone lives in a single household or households with multiple people, acknowledging that larger households require more income to achieve the same standard of living as smaller households.\nWhat this histogram illustrates is how incomes in the UK population is distributed. In some sense this histogram displays all there is to know about the income distribution for everyone in the UK. We could look at similar histograms for other countries and compare these, or we could look at the same image from other years for the UK to compare. However, it turns out that this is not an easy task.\nTo make comparisons between income distributions easier, it is useful to summarise the complex information in this distribution. We call such summary numbers, summary or descriptive statistics. There is no one number which can represent all the information in this distribution. But there are particular summary statistics which represent particular aspects of this distribution. In the above histogram you can already see two such summary statistics, the mean and the median income. These are both location measures or measures of the average. Other summary statistics can tell us something about the dispersion or variance.\nIn the following we will introduce different measures of location, dispersion and skewness. But these are not the only summative or descriptive statistics there are. In particular when looking at income distributions there is a lot of interest in the amount of inequality. A number of measures have been developed ot represent the amount of inequality in a particular income distribution. We will briefly discuss such measures at the end of this lesson.\nWe shall look at three categories of numerical summaries:",

    "section": "4.2 Location Measures",
    "text": "4.2 Location Measures\nA measure of location tells us something about what a typical value from a set of observations is. We sometimes use the expression central location, central tendency or, more commonly, average. We can imagine it as the value around which the observations in the sample are distributed.\nIn the above example of the UK income distribution two such measures are the median income (UKP 29,600) and the mean income (UKP 35,900). As we will see later, the fact that the mean is larger than the median actually tells us something important about the skewness of the distribution.\n\n4.2.1 The mean\nThe simplest numerical summary (descriptive statistic) of location is the sample (arithmetic) mean:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}=\\frac{(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\ldots +x_{n})}{n}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nIt is obtained by adding up all the values in the sample and dividing this total by the sample size. It uses all the observed values in the sample and is the most popular measure of location since it is particularly easy to deal with theoretically. You will see later that means play an important role when we come to statistical inference.\nLet’s look at an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nYou get the following 5 observations: 6, 2, 8, 10, 9\nWhat is the mean? \n** Which of the following are correct formulae for the calculation of the sample mean? (Multiple correct answers are possible)**\n\nA: \\(\\bar{x}=0.2 \\cdot (6+2+8+10+9)\\) TRUEFALSE\nB: \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot (6+2+8+10+9)\\) TRUEFALSE\nC: \\(\\bar{x}=(6+2+8+10+9)/5\\) TRUEFALSE\nD: \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{4}(6+2+8+10+9)\\) TRUEFALSE\nE: \\(\\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 6+\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 2+\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 8+\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 10+\\frac{1}{5}\\cdot 9\\) TRUEFALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nYou have the following information about a sample of values: 6,7,1,9,10. You also know that there were actually six observations in the sample and you know that the sample mean is 6. What is the missing observation?\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe sample mean of 6 observations is 6, then the six observations add up ot 36. As the 5 given observations sum to 33, this implies that the missing information is 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nOne way to estimate the number of insects and investigate the possible decline of the number of insects is to count insects “collected” on number plates (or to count insect splats). Read this newsstory by Sky News. As you can read there has been a large estimated decline of insects between 2004 when this study was performed first and 2021 when it was repeated. In the the original research you can also get the following pieces of information:\n\nIn 2004, 196,448 insects were sampled over 14,466 journeys comprising 867,595 miles, a splat rate of 0.238 splats per mile.\nIn 2021, 11,712 insects were sampled over 3,348 journeys comprising 121,641 miles, a splat rate of 0.104 splats per mile.\n\nWhat is the average number of insects splats found during a car journey in 2004 and 2021. (answer to 4 decimal points, 4dp, if not indicated otherwise)\nAverage in 2004 = \nAverage in 2021 = \nWhat is the average length of a journey (measured in miles) in 2004 and 2021.\nAverage in 2004 = \nAverage in 2021 = \nWhat is the average number of insects splats found per driven mile 2004 and 2021.\nAverage in 2004 = \nAverage in 2021 = \nWhy does just comparing the average splat rates per mile not give the best possible answer to the question of how much insects have declined?\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item The sample in 2021 is significantly smaller than the sample in 2004.\n        \\item The car journeys in 2004 were significantly longer than those in 2021.\n        \\item Methods to measure the length of car journeys differed from 2004 (car odometer readings) to 2021 (an app calculated the journey length from satellite data)\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n The sample in 2021 is significantly smaller than the sample in 2004. The car journeys in 2004 were significantly longer than those in 2021. Methods to measure the length of car journeys differed from 2004 (car odometer readings) to 2021 (an app calculated the journey length from satellite data)\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nThe sample size should not be such a big issue. The sample in 2021 still feels fairly substantial. But the quite different average length of journey could indicate that the type of journeys undertaken could be quite different (e.g. relatively more build up areas in 2021), and that may make a difference for the number of insects collected. Different ways to measure important aspects like journey length might matter, but is unlikely to make a uge difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSpecial case - mean of binary variables\n\n\n\nAn important special case arises when we calculate the mean of a binary variable. Let’s say you have a sample of 7 people and you are interested in whether they have completed a university education. The data in the table below represent the available information.\n\n\n\nRespondent\nUni Degree\nu\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo\n0\n\n\n2\nNo\n0\n\n\n3\nYes\n1\n\n\n4\nYes\n1\n\n\n5\nYes\n1\n\n\n6\nNo\n0\n\n\n7\nYes\n1\n\n\n\nThe last column of the table is an alternative, and very useful way to represent this information. We created a new variable, \\(u\\), which takes the value 1 for all respondents who have a completed university degree and 0 for all others. We call this a binary variable, a variable which can take one of two outcomes.\nWhen you calculate the sample mean of the new variable (\\(u\\)) you obtain\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\bar{u}=\\frac{1}{7}\\sum_{i=1}^{7} u_{i}=\\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{4}{7} = 0.5714\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThis is the sample mean of the variable \\(u\\) but also the proportion of respondents with a university degree. Here, and for future use, it is important that the sample proportion can be thought of as a sample mean (of the variable \\(u\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nWhat is the proportion of respondents who do not have a completed university degree?\n\n\n\nFeedback\n\nAs this is a binary variable this will be 1 - 0.5714. But it would also be the average calculated as follows: \\(\\frac{1}{7}\\sum_{i=1}^{7} (1-u_{i})=\\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{3}{7} = 0.4286\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 The median\nAnother measure, with which you may be familiar, is the sample median. This does not use all the values in the sample and is obtained by finding the middle value in the sample, once all the observations have been ordered from the smallest value to the largest. Thus, \\(50\\%\\) of the observations are larger than the median and \\(50\\%\\) are smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nConsider the following sample of values: 6, 2, 8, 10, 9\nWhat is the mean? \nWhat is the median? \n\n\nFeedback\n\nYou get the median by re-arranging the values in ascending order and then identify the middle value, here: 2, 6, 8, 9, 10. As we have 5 observations the middle observation is the 3rd, hence 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n####Exercise What to you do if you have an even number of observation? Say: 3, 9, 3, 4, 6, 7.\\\nYou still line all the observations up in ascending order: 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. Now you have two middle observation, the 3rd and the 4th, here these are 4 and 6. It is then the convention that we take the midpoint between these two values to get the median.\nWhat is the mean? \nWhat is the median? \n\n\nFeedback\n\nSo here the midpoint between 4 and 6 is 5. But really, any value between 4 and 6 meets the above definition of the median. Take for instance 4.5. 50% of observations are smaller than 4.5 and 50% are larger than 4.5. Therefore 4.5 also meets the definition of the median. But here we shall stick to the convention of using the average of the two middle values. (See the section on percentiles below for a follow up on this point)\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the above examples, to calculate the mean we use all the data in the sample. But for the median we only use the middle (or the two middle) observations. The median does not use all the data and is less influenced by extreme values (or outliers), compared to the sample mean. For example, when investigating income distributions it is found that the mean income is typically higher than the median income. You can see that also from the above graphical representation of the UK income distribution, where the mean income is around UKP 6000 larger than the median.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nReturn to the previous exercise with sample of values: 6, 2, 8, 10, 9. For these values the sample mean was 7 and the median was 8. Let us assume that the largest of these values is actually a 100 not a 10. What are the mean and median in this case?\nWhat is the mean? \nWhat is the median? \nImagine the highest \\(10\\%\\) of earners in a country double their income, but the income of everyone else remains constant. What effect will that have on the mean on the one hand, and the median on the other?\nThe mean will increasenot changedecrease\nThe median will increasenot changedecrease\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Weighted mean\nIn some situations, it makes more sense to use a weighted sample mean, rather than the arithmetic mean. Before we look at what a weighted mean does we shall reformulate the arithmetic mean to the following equivalent formula:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n    \\bar{x}&=&\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}=\\frac{(x_{1}+x_{2}+\\ldots +x_{n})}{n}\\\\\n    &=&\\frac{1}{n} x_{1}+\\frac{1}{n}x_{2}+\\ldots +\\frac{1}{n}x_{n}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\nYou can see from the last form that the mean is a weighted sum of all observations where each observation obtains the same weight of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\).\nLet’s say you want to figure out what the Covid incidence in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Netherlands is in Week 10 of 2022. You have the following table with observation (drawn from spreadsheet, Covid_ECDC.xlsx, sheet: CrossSection).\n\n\n\nCountry\nWeek\nCase Rate\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\n2022 - Week 10\n879.8\n11,566,041\n\n\nFrance\n2022 - Week 10\n1192.0\n67,656,682\n\n\nLuxembourg\n2022 - Week 10\n1726.2\n634,730\n\n\nNetherlands\n2022 - Week 10\n4795.3\n17,475,415\n\n\n\nLet’s say you calculate the arithmetic mean for the case rate (14-day average, calculated per 100,000 population) for these countries.\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\bar{x}=\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i=BEL}^{NED}x_{i}=\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 879.8 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1192.0 +\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1726.2 +\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 4795.3  = 2,148.3\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nSo the mean value is 2,148.3. Is that the case rate in the four countries taken together? \\ No it is not. In the above calculation we weighted the data for France in the same way as that of Luxembourg although the latter only has about 1% of France’s population. If we wanted to use the above data to calculate what the Case rate across the four countries is we should take the different country sizes into account. Let’s supplement the above table with a new column which calculates the proportion of population each of the four countries has of the combined population (97,332,868).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nWeek\nCase Rate\nPopulation\nPop prop, \\(w_i\\)\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\n2022 - Week 10\n879.8\n11,566,041\n0.119\n\n\nFrance\n2022 - Week 10\n1192.0\n67,656,682\n0.695\n\n\nLuxembourg\n2022 - Week 10\n1726.2\n634,730\n0.006\n\n\nNetherlands\n2022 - Week 10\n4795.3\n17,475,415\n0.180\n\n\n\nAs you can see, France has 69.5% (0.695) of the combined population and Luxembourg only 0.6% (0.006). So when we calculate the case rate across the four countries we should weigh France much higher. Note that the weights do sum to 1!\nThe way in which we calculate a case rate which then represents the (population weighted) average across the four countries is\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\bar{x}_w=0.119 \\cdot 879.8 + 0.695 \\cdot 1192.0 +0.006 \\cdot 1726.2 +0.180 \\cdot 4795.3  = 1,806.659\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nTherefore the population weighted average is 1,806.659, a fair bit lower than the unweighted average.\nLet’s look at the general formula for the weighted average:\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n    \\bar{x}_w=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}=w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}+\\ldots+w_{n}x_{n}.\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhere the weights \\(\\left( w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{n}\\right)\\) satisfy \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1\\). Note that equal weights of \\(w_{i}=n^{-1}\\), for all \\(i\\), gives the arithmetic mean. This type of average statistic if often used in the construction of index numbers (such as the Consumer Price Index, CPI) and it comes into play whenever we have data from different categories that are of different importance (as countries in the above example). In the calculation of the CPI this is relevant as price increases for food items are more important than price increases for music, as the purchases for the latter use a smaller proportion of a typical income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantExercise\n\n\n\nConsider the following data on the youth unemployment rate in the following cities/towns\n\n\n\nCity\nUnemployment Rate\nPopulation (18-25 yrs)\n\n\n\n\nSpringfield\n29.9\n6,241\n\n\nDuckburg\n11.0\n452,189\n\n\nNingzhou\n13.9\n7,457,632\n\n\nGotham City\n16.4\n13,298,115\n\n\n\nWhat is the arithmetic (unweighted) mean? \nWhat is the (population) weighted mean?",
